<a href="#">LIVE PLANTS</a></p>


<p class="article"><img class="leftimage" src="images/plant.jpg" alt="plant">Oxygenating pond plants are true aquatic plants which will grow completely submerged in the water. These plants are also well suited to the home aquarium, and are very versatile. Anacharis and other oxygenating plants will not hold up well over extreme cold winters, but they will survive with partial die back in zones which don't get completely frozen. These plants help maintain a high level of oxygen in ponds and they also help compete against algae for nutrients which helps to choke the algae out.</p>

<a href="#">AQUARIUM</a></p>

<p class="article"><img class="leftimage" src="images/aquarium.jpg" alt="aqua">An aquarium (plural aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium consisting of at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, marine mammals, turtles, and aquatic plants. The term combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning "a place for relating to". An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic plastic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.</p>
